# IntroToSwift

Swift is a modern, multi-paradigm programming language developed by Apple Inc. in 2014. It is designed to be fast, safe, and easy to use for developing software for Apple's various operating systems, including macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

Swift is a statically typed language, meaning that the type of a variable must be declared explicitly, and it supports both object-oriented and functional programming paradigms. It features a concise and expressive syntax, making it easier for developers to write and read code.

Some of the key features of Swift include optionals, which allow developers to handle values that may be absent or undefined, and a powerful type inference system that can automatically deduce the type of a variable based on its context. It also supports closures, which are similar to functions but can be defined inline, and has built-in support for common programming tasks such as string manipulation, arrays, and dictionaries.

Swift is an open-source language, meaning that its source code is freely available to developers and it is continually evolving through community contributions and updates from Apple.
